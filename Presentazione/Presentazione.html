      <h2> Hobbies & Soft Skills </h2>
      
        <p1 id="hobbies"> I studied music from the age of 5 which made me develop discipline and the ability to work under pressure.
          I was a scout until the age of 23, an experience that taught me teamwork and interpersonal relationship management.
          I am a quick learner and my laziness makes me an excellent problem solver

      <h1>Professional Summary</h2>
    
      <p1> I am a passionate compositing artist with international experience in the movies & TV industry. 
      My previous experience includes working in the postvis team of The Third Floor Inc. in London, UK. 
      Additionally, I have a background in game design and project management, having worked as a game designer and project manager for MFE SRL, a small indie studio that I co-founded. 
      During my time at MFE SRL, I successfully wrote and produced a 2D mobile game called

        "Eraze That!"
      </a>  
      I was responsible for managing an internal team of five individuals, as well as coordinating external collaborations. This experience allowed me to develop strong leadership and organizational skills in addition to my creative expertise.
      Furthermore, I have pursued continuous professional development and learning opportunities. 
      After completing my master's in computer graphics at BigRock, where I was recognized as one of the top 10 students out of 80.
      In order to refine my skills, I also participated in a specialized course on Nuke, led by Victor Perez. 
      This has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the software and its applications, allowing me to excel in my role as a compositing artist.
      Overall, my diverse background in both compositing artistry and game design, along with my international industry experience,
      demonstrates my ability to adapt to different creative environments and effectively collaborate within interdisciplinary teams.
      I am constantly seeking personal projects and learning opportunities to further enhance my skill set and contribute to innovative and impactful productions.
